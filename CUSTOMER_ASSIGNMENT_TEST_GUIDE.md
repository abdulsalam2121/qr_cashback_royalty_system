# Customer Assignment Logic - Quick Test Guide

## üéØ How to Test the Fix

### 1. **Prepare Test Data**
1. Create some customers (if not already existing)
2. Assign cards to some customers (make them "active")
3. Block some customer cards
4. Leave some customers without any cards

### 2. **Test the Customer Dropdown Logic**

#### ‚úÖ **Should Appear in Dropdown:**
- **John Doe** - New customer, no cards assigned
- **Jane Smith** - Has blocked cards only
- **Bob Wilson** - Had a card, but it was blocked

#### ‚ùå **Should NOT Appear in Dropdown:**
- **Alice Johnson** - Has an active card already
- **Mike Brown** - Has an unassigned card waiting for activation

### 3. **Testing Steps**

1. **Go to Cards Management page**
2. **Create a new unassigned card** (if needed)
3. **Click "Assign" on an unassigned card**
4. **Check "Assign to existing customer" radio button**
5. **Open the customer dropdown**

**Expected Result**: Only customers without active cards or with blocked cards only should appear.

### 4. **Test Scenarios**

#### Scenario A: Customer with No Cards
- **Status**: Should appear in dropdown ‚úÖ
- **Reason**: New customer, available for first card

#### Scenario B: Customer with Active Card
- **Status**: Should NOT appear in dropdown ‚ùå
- **Reason**: Already has an active card

#### Scenario C: Customer with Blocked Card
- **Status**: Should appear in dropdown ‚úÖ
- **Reason**: Can be assigned a new card to replace blocked one

#### Scenario D: Customer with Mixed Cards (Active + Blocked)
- **Status**: Should NOT appear in dropdown ‚ùå
- **Reason**: Has at least one active card

### 5. **UI Messages to Verify**

#### When Customers Available:
- Dropdown shows eligible customers
- Blue info box explains the logic
- "Each customer can only have one active card at a time"

#### When No Customers Available:
- Empty dropdown
- Message: "No customers available for card assignment. All customers already have active cards or create a new customer instead."
- User should create new customer

### 6. **Business Logic Verification**

**Rule**: One customer = One active card maximum

**Before Fix**: Could assign multiple active cards to same customer ‚ùå
**After Fix**: Only shows customers eligible for new card assignment ‚úÖ

## üéâ Success Criteria

‚úÖ Dropdown only shows customers without active cards
‚úÖ Customers with blocked cards appear (can get replacement)
‚úÖ Customers with active cards don't appear
‚úÖ Clear messaging explains the logic
‚úÖ "Create new customer" option always available
‚úÖ Search works within available customers only

**The customer assignment logic now perfectly prevents duplicate active card assignments!**
