# Card Limit & Subscription Ordering System - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## üéØ Project Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive card limit tracking and ordering system for the QR Cashback Loyalty Platform. This system enables platform administrators to set card allowances for subscription plans and allows tenant administrators to order physical cards within their allocated limits.

## üèóÔ∏è What Was Built

### 1. Enhanced Database Schema

#### Tenant Model Enhancements
```sql
-- Added to tenants table
subscriptionCardLimit    INTEGER DEFAULT 0    -- Cards from current subscription
subscriptionCardsUsed    INTEGER DEFAULT 0    -- Cards used from subscription
totalCardAllowance       INTEGER DEFAULT 40   -- Total available cards
currentCardBalance       INTEGER DEFAULT 40   -- Current available balance
```

#### Plan Model Enhancements
```sql
-- Added to plans table
cardAllowance           INTEGER DEFAULT 0     -- Cards included with plan
allowCardOrdering       BOOLEAN DEFAULT true  -- Whether plan allows ordering
```

#### Card Order Model Enhancements
```sql
-- Added to card_orders table
sourceType              OrderSourceType DEFAULT 'SUBSCRIPTION'
deductFromBalance       BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
approvedAt              TIMESTAMP
approvedBy              TEXT
stripeSessionId         TEXT
stripePaymentId         TEXT
paidAt                  TIMESTAMP
```

#### New Card Limit Transaction Model
```sql
CREATE TABLE card_limit_transactions (
    id                  TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    tenantId            TEXT NOT NULL,
    type                CardLimitTransactionType NOT NULL,  -- GRANTED, USED, REFUNDED, EXPIRED
    source              CardLimitTransactionSource NOT NULL, -- TRIAL, SUBSCRIPTION_UPGRADE, etc.
    amount              INTEGER NOT NULL,
    previousBalance     INTEGER NOT NULL,
    newBalance          INTEGER NOT NULL,
    description         TEXT,
    relatedOrderId      TEXT,
    relatedPlanId       TEXT,
    createdAt           TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    createdBy           TEXT
);
```

### 2. Core Service Layer - CardLimitService

#### Main Functions Implemented:
- `getCardBalance(tenantId)` - Get current balance and limits
- `updateCardBalance(update)` - Update balance with audit trail
- `grantSubscriptionCards()` - Auto-grant cards on subscription upgrade
- `useCardsForOrder()` - Deduct cards for orders
- `refundCardsFromOrder()` - Refund cards for cancelled orders
- `canOrderCards()` - Check if tenant can order specific quantity
- `getTransactionHistory()` - Get complete audit trail

#### Key Features:
- **Transactional Safety**: All balance updates use database transactions
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every change is logged with who, what, when, why
- **Balance Validation**: Prevents negative balances and over-ordering
- **Flexible Sources**: Tracks whether cards came from trial, subscription, or additional purchase

### 3. Enhanced API Endpoints

#### Card Orders API (`/api/t/:tenantSlug/card-orders`)
- `GET /` - List tenant's orders
- `POST /` - Create new order with balance validation
- `GET /pricing` - Get current card pricing
- `GET /eligibility` - Check if tenant can order cards
- `GET /balance` - Get current card balance and breakdown
- `GET /balance/history` - Get transaction history

#### Platform Admin API (`/api/platform`)
- `POST /plans` - Create plans with card allowance settings
- `PUT /plans/:id` - Update plan card allowances
- `POST /card-orders/:id/approve` - Approve pending orders
- `POST /card-orders/:id/reject` - Reject orders and refund cards
- `GET /card-orders` - View all orders across tenants

### 4. Business Logic Implementation

#### Subscription Upgrade Flow
1. **Plan Selection**: Tenant selects subscription plan
2. **Payment Processing**: Stripe handles payment
3. **Automatic Card Grant**: System automatically grants cards based on plan's `cardAllowance`
4. **Audit Trail**: Transaction recorded with subscription upgrade source
5. **Balance Update**: Tenant's `currentCardBalance` updated in real-time

#### Card Ordering Flow
1. **Eligibility Check**: System validates available balance and plan permissions
2. **Order Creation**: Order created with `PENDING_APPROVAL` status
3. **Balance Deduction**: Cards immediately deducted from balance (if applicable)
4. **Platform Approval**: Platform admin reviews and approves/rejects
5. **Fulfillment**: Approved orders move to shipping workflow
6. **Refund Logic**: Rejected orders automatically refund cards to balance

#### Balance Calculation Logic
```typescript
// Real-time balance calculation
currentBalance = totalCardAllowance - cardsUsedFromAllSources
totalCardAllowance = freeTrialLimit + subscriptionCardLimit + additionalPurchases
subscriptionRemaining = subscriptionCardLimit - subscriptionCardsUsed
```

## üéÆ How The System Works

### For Platform Administrators

#### 1. Plan Creation & Management
```typescript
// Example: Creating a plan with card allowance
{
  name: "Professional Plan",
  priceMonthly: 49,
  cardAllowance: 500,           // 500 cards included
  allowCardOrdering: true       // Plan allows ordering more cards
}
```

#### 2. Order Management
- **Approval Queue**: View all pending card orders across all tenants
- **Quick Actions**: Approve or reject orders with reason tracking
- **Analytics**: Track card usage patterns and plan effectiveness

### For Tenant Administrators

#### 1. Subscription Benefits
```typescript
// When upgrading to Professional Plan:
// - Current balance: 40 (trial)
// - Subscription grants: +500 cards
// - New total: 540 cards available
```

#### 2. Card Ordering Process
```typescript
// Check eligibility
GET /api/t/my-store/card-orders/eligibility
// Response: { canOrder: true, availableBalance: 540, maxQuantity: 540 }

// Place order
POST /api/t/my-store/card-orders
{
  cardType: "SINGLE_SIDED",
  quantity: 100,
  storeName: "My Coffee Shop",
  shippingAddress: "123 Main St..."
}
```

#### 3. Balance Tracking
```typescript
// Real-time balance
GET /api/t/my-store/card-orders/balance
{
  currentBalance: 440,          // After ordering 100 cards
  totalAllowance: 540,
  subscriptionLimit: 500,
  subscriptionUsed: 100,
  trialLimit: 40,
  trialUsed: 0
}
```

## üìä Plan Configuration Examples

### Starter Plan (‚Ç¨19/month)
- **Card Allowance**: 100 cards included
- **Card Ordering**: Enabled
- **Target**: Small businesses, cafes

### Professional Plan (‚Ç¨49/month)
- **Card Allowance**: 500 cards included
- **Card Ordering**: Enabled  
- **Target**: Growing businesses, multiple locations

### Enterprise Plan (‚Ç¨99/month)
- **Card Allowance**: 2000 cards included
- **Card Ordering**: Enabled
- **Target**: Large chains, enterprise customers

## üîÑ Order Status Workflow

```
PENDING_PAYMENT (for paid additional orders)
    ‚Üì
PENDING_APPROVAL (awaiting platform admin review)
    ‚Üì
APPROVED/CANCELLED (platform admin decision)
    ‚Üì
PENDING (ready for fulfillment)
    ‚Üì
PROCESSING (being prepared)
    ‚Üì
SHIPPED (tracking provided)
    ‚Üì
DELIVERED (final status)
```

## üîç Audit Trail & Transaction Types

### Transaction Types
- **GRANTED**: Cards added (subscription upgrade, manual adjustment)
- **USED**: Cards deducted for orders
- **REFUNDED**: Cards returned from cancelled orders
- **EXPIRED**: Cards removed due to expiration (future feature)

### Transaction Sources
- **TRIAL**: From initial 40-card trial allowance
- **SUBSCRIPTION_UPGRADE**: From plan subscription
- **CARD_ORDER**: From physical card ordering
- **MANUAL_ADJUSTMENT**: Admin manual changes

### Example Transaction History
```typescript
[
  {
    type: "GRANTED",
    source: "SUBSCRIPTION_UPGRADE", 
    amount: 500,
    description: "Cards granted from Professional Plan upgrade",
    previousBalance: 40,
    newBalance: 540,
    createdAt: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
  },
  {
    type: "USED",
    source: "CARD_ORDER",
    amount: -100,
    description: "Cards used for order #ORD-123",
    previousBalance: 540,
    newBalance: 440,
    createdAt: "2024-01-16T14:30:00Z"
  }
]
```

## üí∞ Pricing Structure

### Physical Card Pricing
- **Single-Sided Cards**: ‚Ç¨2.10 per card
- **Double-Sided Custom**: ‚Ç¨3.90 per card

### Business Model
1. **Subscription Cards**: Included in monthly plan (no additional cost)
2. **Additional Cards**: Pay-per-card pricing when exceeding plan allowance
3. **Trial Cards**: 40 free cards for new tenants
