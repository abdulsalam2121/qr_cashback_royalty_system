## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env` file:
```env
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret

# Frontend URL for CORS
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### 2. Frontend Environment
Create `.env` in the frontend directory:
```env
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
```

### 3. Database Migration
The existing database schema supports the new features without migrations.

### 4. Dependencies
All required dependencies are already included:
- Backend: `stripe`, `html5-qrcode`, `express-rate-limit`
- Frontend: `@stripe/stripe-js`, `@stripe/react-stripe-js`, `html5-qrcode`

## Usage Flow

### Customer Login Flow
1. Customer visits `/customer/login`
2. Chooses QR scan or manual entry
3. For QR: Scans card with camera
4. For Manual: Enters Card UID
5. System validates card and creates session
6. Redirects to dashboard

### Fund Addition Flow
1. Customer navigates to "Add Funds" tab
2. Enters amount ($1-$500 range)
3. Enters credit card details (Stripe Elements)
4. Payment is processed securely
5. Fund addition is confirmed via webhook
6. Balance updates immediately
7. Email notification sent (if email available)

### Security Considerations
- Sessions expire after 24 hours
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Card UIDs are validated against database
- Payment processing is PCI compliant
- Input sanitization on all endpoints

## Testing

### Test the Complete Flow
1. **Create a test card** in the admin panel
2. **Activate the card** and assign to a customer with email
3. **Visit** `/customer/login`
4. **Scan QR or enter Card UID** to login
5. **View dashboard** - check balance display
6. **Add funds** - test payment processing
7. **Check email** - verify notification received
8. **View transactions** - confirm fund addition recorded

### Test Security
- Try accessing dashboard without login (should redirect)
- Test rate limiting by making many requests
- Verify session expiration after 24 hours
- Test with invalid card UIDs

## Production Considerations

### 1. Session Storage
- Replace in-memory session storage with Redis
- Implement session cleanup background job
- Add session refresh mechanism

### 2. Email Processing
- Set up proper email service (SendGrid, AWS SES)
- Process notification queue with background workers
- Add email delivery tracking

### 3. Monitoring
- Add logging for all customer actions
- Monitor payment success/failure rates
- Track session creation and expiration

### 4. Performance
- Add caching for customer dashboard data
- Optimize transaction history queries
- Consider CDN for static assets

## Integration with Existing System

The customer dashboard integrates seamlessly with the existing loyalty system:

- **Uses existing Card and Customer models**
- **Leverages current transaction recording system**
- **Extends existing notification framework**
- **Integrates with current Stripe subscription system**
- **Maintains all existing admin functionality**

Customers can now independently manage their loyalty cards while all admin features remain unchanged.
